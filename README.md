foreman-jenkins-plugin
======================

A plugin that integrates foreman (theforeman.org) with jenkins ci.

It allows you to create a new virtual machine to use inside jenkins via a pre-defined
hostgroup in foreman. 

The VM can be created on any cloud service supported in foreman: oVirt, libvirt, amazon, vmware.
